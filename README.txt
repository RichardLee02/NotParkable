Extra Information:

In our original proposal, we were intending to use Oracle for the DBMS. However, as we were unable to connect to the database via Oracle, we had to use PostgreSQL instead. In addition, to allow for more interesting queries, we decided to change the one-to-one relationship of vechicleOwner and vehicle to one-to-many.
